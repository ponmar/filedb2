## About

This is a project for storing, maintaining and presenting meta-data (persons, locations and tags) for files. A typical use case is to make a picture and video collection searchable and for running slideshows with extra information.

FileDB provides a desktop application and ways for exporting data to 3rd party applications.

FileDB pros:

* Own your data: No data is shared with other parties
* Control your data: All data is stored in an SQLite database and may be converted for future use depending on your future needs (no lock-in effect). The FileDB application has support for exporting to JSON format.
* Search cababilities: Find files given a basic search criteria. Combine basic search criterias for creating an advanced search criteria
* The built-in file browser supports showing extra data such as person age
* 3rd party software integrations

FileDB cons:

* Categorizing files is a bit time consuming. However, the main application tries to make this process as simple as possible. Competing cloud services usually identifies persons automatically with face recognition, but that feature is not implemented in FileDB.

### Main Application

The FileDB main application is the GUI towards the internal database that stores the file meta-data. This application includes file browsing, meta-data editing and advanced search features.

The application uses one configuration file that, for example, points out the file collection root directory.

A demo configuration with some images and meta-data is available to show case the FileDB potential.

### 3rd Party Software Integrations

FileDB gives you the possibility to export the internal database and file searches to your own applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A collection of files.

  **Note:** it is recommended to have a backup procedure for your file collection before running FileDB (although FileDB itself does not modify your files).

If you want to test FileDB or your collection of files is not ready the [demo](https://github.com/ponmar/filedb2_demo/) can be used.

## Documentation
